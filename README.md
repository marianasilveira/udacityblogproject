## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivationa

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 for answering the following questions

1. Could the pandemic possibly have affected the Employment Status of programmers worldwide?
2. Are there more programmers breaking into the field possibly because of the COVID-19 pandemic?
3. Are the results different for respondents from countries whose economies were more severely affected??

These are complicated questions, indeed. The main goal is not to obtain an ultimate conclusion, but to play around with data and have a look at its behaviour. 

## File Descriptions
One notebook file (1st_project.ipynb) and four datasets are available here. After extracting each dataset, copy the file 'survey_results_public_XXXX.csv' to the notebook's directory.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available on https://medium.com/@marianalyrasilveira/the-stack-overflow-community-an-analysis-before-and-after-pandemic-71f8a64b9035).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](httpswww.kaggle.comstackoverflowso-survey-2017data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
